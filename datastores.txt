Goals
- make students comfortable with asking questions about how they are accessing their data
- give students a broad survey of what is possible and enough concepts that they can dig into whatever might be applicable to their environment
- feel empowered - you are in charge of your data, In Soviet Russia, your data is is charge of you
- threee stages: get it working, get it working right, get it working quickly
  - focus here on making it possible to "get it working" by providing samples for different methods of data access
  - learn concepts that enable asking more informed questions when you undertake a data project
- "A beginning is a very delicate time" - Dune quote - the way you think about accessing your data influences the rest of your project
  - two phases of a software process to consider: development and operations
  - here, we want to be comfortable with development with a mind towards adapting what we develop into something that
    other people won't regret we wrote...


What is a datastore?
- place where data is stored... what does this mean?
- way to abstract "storage details" from an application
  - lots of different concerns/use cases result in lots of different ways to read and write data
- does this matter? yes and no... if you're reading data, there are some things you might care about:
  - where it comes from
  - what its "shape" is
  - performance/storage
- examples:
  - file
  - SQL databases
  - No-SQL databases
  - API


What is an API?
- stands for Application Programming Interface
- in short, a way for a program (application) to talk to another program programmatically
  - memory based (e.g programs importing logic/capabilities from other programs)
    - importing libraries
    - talking to the operating system
  - network level protocols (difference between protocol and API... we'll pretend there are none for the sake of this
    discussion, but I'm happy to discuss more offline)
    - standard APIs (e.g. HTTP, ODBC, FTP, etc.)
  - custom ways to access functionality exposed via networking protocols
    - typically data you might get over the Internet for a certain dataset or website, tailored for accessing that content
    - formats are typically JSON or XML


Great... why aren't we programming yet?
